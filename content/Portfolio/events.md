## Infection
The objective of the game is faction dominance by turning as many humans into monsters or curing the monsters back into humans, depending which faction the player sides with.
Dynamic cool-downs ensure no faction gains snowball-like advantage throughout the duration of the event.

Players can join one of six factions and engage in a thrilling battle for dominance between three monster factions and their respective hunter factions.

Vampires can only be cured by Vampire Hunters, while Werewolves can only be cured by Huntsmen. Zombies, on the other hand, can be cured by Enchanters. Monsters cannot bite the faction that hunts them, but they can bite other factions. For example, Vampires cannot bite Vampire Hunters, but they can bite Huntsmen. Hunters can also help each other by protecting others from being bitten for a short period of time. 

## Fear
Players needs to collect candies, which they can then use to claim their initial fear once someone asks them for trick or treat. Once they have accumulated enough fear, they can summon an army of spooky creatures, such as imps, skeletons, and other fearsome beings. Players can use their army to scare other players or challenge powerful bosses. Finally, players can also sacrifice their army for Reinforced Fear, final resource that places them on a leader-board.

The main objective is to become the most feared player in the game by maintaining the highest amount of Reinforced Fear. Players can achieve this by strategically gathering candies, summoning powerful armies, successfully scaring other players or defeating bosses and finally, sacrificing their army.

## Gifting
Join the spirit of sharing-is-caring by collecting and giving presents to others! Players can collect presents, give them away to other players, and/or steal presents from one another.

## Snowballs
Simplest digital snow-fun you've had without going outside by throwing snowballs at other players who recently sent a message. Got a grudge? Simply bait them to send a message, prepare, aim and... Throw*! What a satisfyin... what, you missed? Happens! Now THEY want to throw a snowball at you? Like what have you done to them? Attempted to throw a snowball at them? Ouch, they'll hold that grudge.

*You need to collect or have enough collected snow before being able to throw, don't say no one warned you!
