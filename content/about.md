Hello stranger. 

## Who am I?
I've been wearing many hoodies, and these are my Tales.

In a nutshell, my adventure with programming began in 2014, and in 2018 I've started programming in **Python**. 
Then in 2019 I've coded **Discord bot** for one of servers I've been managing. As pandemic started in 2020, so did I start working full-time on what's been a hobby project.

I'm also interested in **Cyber Security**, and have some *Red Team/Pentesting* experience.
Few years later, I wake up with what seems to fit backend description under my belt: Databases, API, Caching, DevOps, Security... You name it.

But there's no rest for the wicked as in the meantime I've also developed minigames while voluneering as a moderator for gaming Discord servers, made couple of puzzles and played guitar.
Now we are in 2024 and I've started training Parkour and eventually set off to explore Europe by Train with Interrail.

## Sounds interesting? 
You can find on this website my journals from travels, insights from trenches as a developer, recipes from my kitchen and couple of other things too.
