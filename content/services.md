**What do I do?** Basically... I make machines talk to each other in an automated fashion!

# REST API Development
**Design** & **Implemenation** of custom solution, or **Integration** of existing REST API to facilitate communication between frontend and backend, or to enhance current system.

# Database Design and Management
Schema Design? Management? Views? SQL is no stranger to me. My usual work involves **PostgreSQL**, **Redis** and **Supabase**. I also have experience with designing & implementing queues like **RabbitMQ**.

# DevOps
In need of a **Docker**? Look no further! Contenerization of an application, creating a stack or automating a pipeline isn't unknown here.

# Discord Bot Development
Looking to automate your Discord server? Improve lives of your moderators ~~(by making them even more miserable by forcing them to relearn commands?)~~ or engange your community in new ways with custom **minigames**? You know where to find me!

# Penetration Testing
Security audits and **pentesting** of your infrastructure or website? Check.

# Consulting
Don't know what you want or need? Don't worry, we've all been there. I might be able to help, though no promises!

# Training
Starting with **Python**? Looking for a mentor? Or perhaps got a problem you need help solving? Hit me up!

# Writing
Had no I idea I would put it here but... Writing text, or a fluff text, or anything really in a realm of not-too-long-stuff-tho-longer-than-character-limit-on-most-socials-without-AI is also available

# Maintenence/Support
And of course... support, any mistake I've done am willing to rectify... ~~(to a degree)~~
